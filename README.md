**This is a Movie Recommendation Engine written using Python with the help of Sklearn
`In this script I use the CountVectorizer() function from sklearn to count similar words in different movies and rank them
based on their similarity score (cosine_similarity) and print the first 50 movies!`

**The data used in this script has around 5000 titles based on the IMDB dataset. I have only used a few features for convinience but
the number of features can be increased to get better prediction.
